Cohort Analysis for accessing Customer retention in E-Commerce industry

Key Insights from the Cohort Analysis
The analysis focuses on measuring customer retention, quantity sold, and total spend over time, grouped by the customer's acquisition month.

1. Customer Retention (Churn)
High Initial Churn: it shows is a major drop in customer retention from the first month (Cohort Index 1) to the second month (Cohort Index 2) for almost all cohorts.

For example, the December 2010 cohort had a retention rate of 38.19% in the second month.

A more recent cohorts (e.g., November 2011) shows an even sharper drop, retaining only 13.40% of their initial customers by the second month.

Long-Term Stability: Despite the sharp initial drop, the retention rates for the older cohorts (e.g., December 2010, January 2011) tend to stabilize and remain relatively high, often fluctuating in the 33% to 50% range for subsequent months.

2. Purchase Quantity and Monetary Value
Consistent Purchase quantity: The average quantity of products sold per customer remains quite consistent, typically in the 40-50 unit range across all months/cohorts. I noticed that while fewer customers are retained, the ones who remained continue to buy a similar or slightly higher volume of products compared to their first month.

High Total Spend Cohort: The initial cohort (December 2010) accounts for the largest total monetary value (over 1.35 million in the first month and over 1.16 million in the twelfth month), indicating this group represents the most valuable and loyal customers in the dataset.

Recommendations
The primary goal should be to reduce the high initial churn and leverage the consistent purchase behavior of retained customers. To Achieve this

1. Address Early Churn (Month 1 to Month 2)
Onboarding Enhancement: Invest heavily in the post-first-purchase customer experience. Implement a structured onboarding campaign (e.g emails, SMS) in the first 30 days that focuses on product usage tips, personalized recommendations, and a dedicated customer support channel.

Early Incentive: Offer a small, valuable incentive (e.g., 10% off the next purchase, free shipping) to customers who haven't made a second purchase by day 20, specifically targeting the gap between Cohort Index 1 and 2.

2. Reward Loyalty and Boost Average Order Value(AOV)
Loyalty Tiers: Create a tiered loyalty program (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold) that offers increasing benefits (exclusive access, higher discounts) to customers based on their consistent purchase frequency and quantity, which is already high for retained users.

Personalized Bundles: Since customers are buying a consistent quantity (40-50 units), create personalized product bundles or subscriptions based on their past behavior to encourage an increase in Average Order Value (AOV), especially for the high-spending December 2010 cohort.

3. Strategic Marketing Based on Country/Product
Focus on High-Volume Regions: Capitalize on countries showing the highest total quantity sold, such as Togo, South Africa, and Cote d'Ivoire. Tailor marketing and logistics to these regions to maximize operational efficiency and sales.
